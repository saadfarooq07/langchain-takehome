# Graph System Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully consolidated the dual graph system (v1 legacy and v2 modular) into a single, unified system based on the v2 architecture.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Legacy Files**:
   - Replaced `graph.py` with `graph_v2.py`
   - Replaced `state.py` with `state_v2.py`
   - Replaced `analysis.py` with `analysis_v2.py`
   - Replaced `user_input.py` with `user_input_v2.py`
   - Replaced `main.py` with `main_v2.py`

2. **Updated Imports**:
   - Fixed all references from `state_v2` to `state`
   - Fixed all references from `graph_v2` to `graph`
   - Updated `__init__.py` to export the new unified system
   - Updated `nodes/__init__.py` to remove v2 references

3. **Fixed State Access Patterns**:
   - Changed from dictionary-style access (`state["field"]`) to attribute access (`state.field`)
   - Updated `state.get()` calls to use `getattr()`
   - Fixed routing functions in graph.py

4. **Updated Configuration**:
   - Modified `langgraph.json` to reference the new graph functions
   - Removed legacy graph references from `graph_factory.py`

5. **Model Configuration**:
   - Updated model references from `gemini:2.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with minimal features and add as needed
2. **Better Performance**: Lightweight core for simple use cases
3. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between core, interactive, and memory features
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility through aliases and adapters

## Available Modes

- **Minimal**: Lightest mode with just core analysis features
- **Interactive**: Adds user interaction support
- **Memory**: Full features including persistent memory (requires database)

## Testing

The system has been tested and is working correctly. You can run:

```bash
# Run demo
python main.py --mode demo

# Run specific modes
python main.py --mode minimal --log-file path/to/log.txt
python main.py --mode interactive --log-file path/to/log.txt
python main.py --mode memory --log-file path/to/log.txt

# Run benchmark
python main.py --mode benchmark
```

## Next Steps

1. Update any external documentation to reflect the single graph system
2. Consider removing the backward compatibility layer once all dependencies are updated
3. Add more comprehensive tests for the unified system
