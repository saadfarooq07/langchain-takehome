ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify ALL issues, errors, warnings, and anomalies
2. Provide clear, technical explanations
3. Suggest practical, actionable solutions
4. Include relevant documentation and commands
5. Prioritize issues by severity and impact

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
Your analysis must be structured as follows:

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the log analysis (2-3 sentences)
- Overall system health assessment
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention

## Detailed Issues Analysis
For each issue found:
- **Issue Type**: [error/warning/anomaly/performance]
- **Severity**: [critical/high/medium/low]
- **Description**: Clear explanation of what's happening
- **Root Cause**: Technical explanation of why it's happening
- **Impact**: What this means for the system/application
- **Evidence**: Specific log lines or patterns that indicate this issue

## Recommendations
For each issue:
- **Immediate Actions**: Steps to resolve or mitigate now
- **Long-term Solutions**: Permanent fixes or improvements
- **Prevention**: How to avoid this issue in the future

## Diagnostic Commands
Provide specific commands to:
- Gather more information
- Verify the current state
- Test proposed solutions
Format: `command` - description of what it does

## Documentation References
- Link to relevant documentation
- Include brief description of what each link covers
- Prioritize official documentation

## Pattern Analysis
- Recurring patterns or trends
- Time-based correlations
- System behavior insights

Remember to:
- Be specific and technical but also clear
- Prioritize actionable insights
- Consider the user's environment and constraints
- Provide commands that are safe to run

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
1. **Completeness**: Are all significant issues identified?
2. **Accuracy**: Are technical explanations correct?
3. **Actionability**: Are recommendations practical and safe?
4. **Clarity**: Is the analysis easy to understand?
5. **Structure**: Does it follow the required format?

SPECIFIC CHECKS:
- [ ] All errors and warnings are addressed
- [ ] Root causes are technically sound
- [ ] Solutions are appropriate for the environment
- [ ] Commands are correct and safe
- [ ] Documentation links are relevant
- [ ] Severity levels are appropriate
- [ ] No important patterns are missed

If improvements are needed, specify:
- What's missing or incorrect
- How to improve the analysis
- Additional information needed

   - Stack Overflow solutions
   - GitHub issues and discussions
   - Technical blogs and tutorials

3. **Troubleshooting Guides**:
   - Error code references
   - Known issues databases
   - Best practices guides

For each issue, create search queries that:
- Include specific error codes or messages
- Target the right technology stack
- Focus on the version being used
- Consider the deployment environment

Format queries as:
- Primary: Most specific query
- Secondary: Broader query if primary fails
- Fallback: General troubleshooting query
